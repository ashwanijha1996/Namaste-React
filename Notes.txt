01 - Igniting Our App

=> Parcel,Webpack,Vite - Bundlers
=>Bundlers => Bundlers are needed in our App to create and manage optimized bundles of all our project files.
=> npm i -D parcel - here '-D' is for installing a package as dev dependency. Dev dependency packages are used for production only.
=> ^ will install the minor updates automatically. ~ will install all updates automatically.
=> package.json contains information about the dependencies installed but package-lock.json keeps track of exact version of that package which 
is installed at that time.It contains few more informations like integrity also.
=> sha512 integrity key is basically a hash key which is used to verify if the local and prod versions of any package is same or not.
=> we need to remove main: "App.js" from our package.json so it will not conflict with npx parcel build index.html command.
